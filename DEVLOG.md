Chronological build log. Newest first.

## 2026-06-06 — Repo aligned to house style; layer 1–3 core verified

- Restructured into the standard `uv` + `src/` research-repo layout used across
  the sibling projects (Multimodal Cancer Detection template): `pyproject.toml`,
  `.python-version`, `uv.lock`, `src/agroforestry/`, `tests/`, `docs/`,
  `reports/`, `ROADMAP.md`, `DEVLOG.md`, `folder_structure.txt`, `AGENT.md`.
- Code moved into `src/agroforestry/` as a package: `config`, `physics`,
  `features`, `models` (XGBoost quantile + CQR), `validation` (LOSO), `predict`,
  `suitability` (+ two-axis `viability`), `disease`, `optimize`,
  `data/{synth,load}`, `cli/run_pipeline`. Research artifacts (catalogs,
  dashboards, blueprint, economics notes) moved to `reports/` and `docs/`.
- Verified the full pipeline runs end-to-end (synthetic stress-test data):
  LOSO MAE dT_max ≈ 0.72 °C; conformal interval coverage 0.80/0.83/0.80 after
  switching to **group-aware (cross-site) conformal calibration** (fixed earlier
  0.62–0.78 under-coverage).
- Disease layer validated on the pomegranate bahar-timing demo: viability 81
  (dry) vs 14–23 (wet), with wet-tolerant Ganesh beating Bhagwa — the
  microclimate→disease→viability chain working as designed.

## Earlier (pre-repo-alignment) — modelling milestones

- Built layer 1–3 pipeline: physics (Beer–Lambert light, shelterbelt wind) +
  XGBoost quantile offset models + fuzzy limiting-factor suitability + grid
  inverse-design optimiser. Realistic synthetic generator with site-clustered,
  non-linear, heteroscedastic structure and an unobserved site latent.
- Added the disease layer: leaf-wetness-duration estimate, mechanistic infection
  models (bacterial blight, mildews, anthracnose, Sigatoka, foot rot, sunburn),
  variety-susceptibility decomposition (host × pathogen × environment), wired
  into a two-axis `viability` score and a disease-aware optimiser objective.
- Fixes after first real run: group-aware conformal calibration; stronger
  windbreak-porosity penalty (optimum ~0.45, no more solid-wall gaming);
  open-field option for full-sun crops; weak features made genuinely
  uninformative so importance/pruning is a fair test.
- Compiled the crop/disease/variety catalog and data-source catalog; anchored
  suitability verdicts to the Pattukkottai climate baseline.
